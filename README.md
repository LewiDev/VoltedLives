# VoltedLives

This repo contains code for a plugin commission i done for a private server. the client has allowed me to use the code as a project on my portfolio. 

VoltedLives is a Spigot plugin that gives players a specific number of lives in your Minecraft server. Once a player runs out of lives, they will be automatically banned with a custom message and will not be able to rejoin the server. This plugin allows server administrators to enforce stricter gameplay rules, making it perfect for survival challenges or competitive game modes.

# Features:

- Customizable number of lives per player
- Automatic banning after life count reaches zero
- Customizable ban message
- Prevents players from rejoining after being banned
