# VoltedLives - Minecraft Spigot Plugin

VoltedLives is a Spigot plugin that gives players a specific number of lives in your Minecraft server. Once a player runs out of lives, they will be automatically banned with a custom message and will not be able to rejoin the server. This plugin allows server administrators to enforce stricter gameplay rules, making it perfect for survival challenges or competitive game modes.

# Features:

- Customizable number of lives per player
- Automatic banning after life count reaches zero
- Customizable ban message
- Prevents players from rejoining after being banned

This plugin was originally developed as a commission, but the client has allowed me to share the code for portfolio purposes. Feel free to integrate it into your server for a more dynamic and engaging experience!
